	* New 'pid_file', 'allow_users' and 'allow_kill' config

Version 1.0.1 - Wed Jul 12 17:00:00 BST 2001

	* Just bug fixes.  No changes to worry about.

Version 0.99.0 - Tue Dec 26 17:55:00 GMT 2000

	* New 'nick_keep' config directive.  The nickname code has been
	  reworked to accomodate this, as such if the connecting client
	  has a different nickname to dircproxy, the connecting client is
	  now corrected (not dircproxy, as it used to be).

Version 0.8.4 - Thu Dec  7 17:35:00 GMT 2000

	* Just bug fixes.  No changes to worry about.

	* Just bug fixes.  No changes to worry about.

Version 0.8.0 - Fri Nov 10 15:20:00 GMT 2000

	* 'chan_log_dir' and 'other_log_dir' have been removed because
	  they cause usage and security problems.  These have been replaced
	  with 'chan_log_copydir' and 'other_log_copydir' which have a
	  slightly different purpose.

	* The log file format on disk has changed slightly to allow for the
	  new 'relative timestamping'.

	* DCC chat's and send's are now proxied by default through dircproxy.

	* Removed config file options:
		server_dnsretry

		client_timeout

Version 0.7.3 - Wed Sep 27 17:55:00 BST 2000

	* New config file option - "disconnect_on_detach"

Version 0.7.2 - Mon Sep 25 13:13:00 BST 2000

	* If you use a .dircproxyrc in your home directory, this must
	  now have no more then 0700 permissions.  If this is not the
	  case then dircproxy will not start.  This does not apply to
	  the global config file or any supplied with the -f parameter.

Version 0.7.1 - Thu Sep 14 13:15:00 BST 2000

	* Just bug fixes.  No changes to worry about.

Version 0.7.0 - Fri Sep  1 15:00:00 BST 2000

	* The global configuration file is now called dircproxyrc not
	  dircproxy.conf

	* dircproxy is now installed in 'bin' not 'sbin', its a user
	  program after all.

	* Passwords for connection classes must be encrypted in the
	  configuration file using the crypt() function (or contrib/crypt),
	  if you don't like this then edit src/dircproxy.h and turn it off,
	  but thats silly.

	* /DQUIT is gone, try /DIRCPROXY QUIT instead

	* Try /DIRCPROXY HELP

	* Try "man dircproxy" :-)

Version 0.6.2 - Mon Jun 26 16:58:00 BST 2000

	* Changed the logic behind how configuration files are loaded.
	  If you supply one with -f, that is loaded.  If you don't it
	  first tries ~/.dircproxyrc and then tries etc/dircproxy.conf.
	  This means that the config file is no longer installed, and
	  can be found as dircproxy.conf in share/dircproxy or the conf
	  dir of the source.  Also the -G option is no longer valid.

Version 0.6.1 - Thu May 25 15:04:00 BST 2000

	* Just bug fixes.  No changes to worry about.

Version 0.6.0 - Wed May 24 22:33:00 BST 2000

	* There is now a configuration file.  Copy the dircproxyrc.example
	  from the conf directory to your home directory and call it
	  .dircproxyrc - this file contains all the documentation for
	  configuring dircproxy.

Version 0.5.3 - Sat May 13 16:32:00 BST 2000

	* Many of the TODO_CFG_* options defined in dircproxy.h have now
	  been given documentation and renamed.  You'll need to recheck this
	  file if you've changed them.  The PASS/SERVER/BIND ones are still
	  at the bottom and still the same however.

Version 0.5.2 - Fri May 12 23:00:00 BST 2000

	* Initial public release
